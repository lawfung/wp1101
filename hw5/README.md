1. **MC** will clean memory and **C** will clean everything **except for memory**. These are the only two buttons which will take effect when an error occur.
2. **‚Üê** can only delete input numbers (no effect on the result).
3. If you type a long expression such as "1+2\*3=", when \* is typed, 1+2 will be calculated and displayed (3), then when = is typed, it turns out to be 9.
4. The unary operatiors (+/-, %, abs) apply on the number in display **immediately**. But it will take no effect when waiting for a number (after a binary operator is typed and before any number is typed).
